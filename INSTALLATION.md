## Troubleshooting Installation

### Extension Not Loading
**Error**: "Could not load extension"
**Solution**: 
- Check that all files are present in the folder
- Ensure `manifest.json` is in the root directory
- Verify all icon files are in the `icons/` folder

### Icons Not Displaying
**Problem**: Extension loads but no icons show
**Solution**:
- Make sure all 3 PNG files are in the `icons/` folder
- Check file names exactly match: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
- Reload the extension after adding icons

### Permission Errors  
**Problem**: Extension requests unexpected permissions
**Solution**:
- Review the permissions in `manifest.json`
- All requested permissions are necessary for functionality
- Chrome will show what the extension can access
