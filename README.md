## üîß How It Works

### 1. **Page Analysis**
The extension scans web pages for complexity indicators:
- Word length and syllable count
- Sentence structure and length
- Technical jargon frequency
- Reading level assessment

### 2. **Smart Detection Algorithm**
```javascript
// Complexity scoring formula
complexityScore = (complexWords / totalWords) * 100 + 
                 (jargonCount / totalWords) * 200 + 
                 (longSentences / totalSentences) * 50
```

### 3. **Text Processing**
- **Word Replacement**: 40+ complex terms simplified
- **Sentence Restructuring**: Long sentences broken down
- **Jargon Highlighting**: Technical terms get tooltip definitions
- **Context Preservation**: Original meaning maintained

### 4. **User Interface**
